<h2>My Heart Needs You Tonight</h2>

Do you remember that arcade
That we went to and we paid
For some photos in a booth
It was really just an excuse

That summer together
Some of the best times I remember
But August turns September
And all I’ve got’s a picture

While you’re down in Louisiana
Thinking of you everyday
Singing here in Music City
Why’s it feel so far away

I miss you
I need you tonight
I want you
My heart needs you
Tonight


Cruel twist of time
You live your life
And ten years go by
In a blink of an eye

With your hand in mine
The world feels so bright
So I'm wondering why
You're gone

Off in Denver, Colorado
And I feel it everyday
Lying sleepless in Seattle
And my dreams are all the same

I miss you
I need you tonight
I want you
My heart needs you
Tonight

I took a ride down a road
So far from home
Made a turn
Now I'm in the dark alone

I miss you
I need you tonight
I want you
My heart needs you
Tonight
