Then one misty autumn, a man walked by the sea.

He brought along his son to show the place called Honah lee.
He told of days with princes and travels with his friend.
And as he

He thought those days on Cherry Lane would never, ever end.
His son was thrilled with all his tales and laughter soon rang out
From in his cave, old Puff awoke and set sail on the boat.

The mist was not too heavy, not like it was before.
And when the boat came round the coast, old Puff gave out a roar.
Now Jackie’s son keeps lookout perched on Puff’s gigantic tail.
Together they go traveling on the boat with billowed sail.

Nothing lasts forever, not even those gray days
Something always bobs again, in new and different ways
Puff could not believe his ears, when it happened one fine day
Outside his dreary prison cave, Jackie Junior came to play!

So once again they traveled on a boat with billowed sail
And Jackie Junior watched while perched on Puff’s gigantic tail
Still mighty kings and princes would bow whene'er they came
And pirate ships would lower their flags when Puff roared out his name.
