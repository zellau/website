    <p>Sticker Chart is an Google Docs extension intended to help you progress in you writing goals! Set a daily wordcount goal and the extension will track your progress toward it across all your Google Docs. See how many consecutive days you have achieved your goal. Check how many words you have written on each of the last several days. Freeze your progress before heading on a trip and unfreeze it when you get back.</p>
