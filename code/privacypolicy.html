<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

Dot Dash saves none of the user’s information. It does not send information anywhere, except as directed by user. The user can chose not to enable any of these functions and much of the app will still work, with the exception of everything described below.

<h3>Camera</h3>

Dot Dash doesn’t actually use the camera. It uses the device flashlight, which can only be accessed through the camera. If the user grants this permission, the app will be able to flash Morse Code in the light.

<h3>SMS</h3>
The transmit option in the app allows the user to tap out a message in Morse Code that the app will translate into text. If the user wishes to send the message to a friend, they can do so by hitting the send button. The app will then use the phone’s texting capabilities to send the message to a selected contact. This is the only time we send information outside of the app.

An option in settings allows the app to play a Morse Code message alerting the user when a text is received. This requires that the phone be alerted when this happens. One message option is the contents of the text in Morse Code, which requires the app be able to read the incoming message. Dot Dash does not save this information in any way once the message has been played.

<h3>Contacts</h3>

Another message option is the name of the contact who sent it, or their phone number if they aren’t a contact. Dot Dash does not save this information in any way once the name has been played.

<h3>TL;DR</h3>
Dot Dash only uses requested permissions in the specific ways listed above. If you don’t want any of these functionalities, feel free to deny the relevant permission. The rest of the app should work fine.
