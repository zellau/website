        ONCE there was a man and a woman with three beautiful daughters. The man and the woman did their best to take care of their daughters, but they weren't very good at listening to them. Their youngest daughter was sweet and gentle and looked up to her sisters and her mother and wanted to be just like them. Unfortunately, her parents were under the impression that she was a boy called Cinder.
        <br />
        <br />
        As the girl grew, her mother began to separate her from her sisters. While the sisters worked together with their mother on cooking and needlework, the girl was sent to chop wood and fix their broken front gate. The girl desperately wanted to learn the skills her sisters were working and to be able to work with them instead of all by herself, but her mother said that it would be inappropriate for a boy.
        <br />
        <br />
        The girl did her best to be patient with her mother and did her chores with only a little complaining. In her free time she learned to cook and sew on her own, but when her sisters caught her they teased her.
        <br />
        <br />
        One day, the king announced a ball, inviting all of the eligible young maidens to come to the castle and meet the prince. The girl's sisters were delighted to be invited. They started talking about what they would wear immediately.
        <br />
        <br />
        "I want to go too!" the girl cried, "What should I wear?"
        <br />
        <br />
        Her sisters laughed at her. "Sweetheart, it's for girls." they said, "You wouldn't like it anyway. It will just be a lot of dancing and girly things."
        <br />
        <br />
        "I love dancing!" the girl reminded her sisters, "And girly things!"
        <br />
        <br />
        "People would only laugh at you if you went to the ball." her sisters said.
        <br />
        <br />
        "Cheer up, bud." her dad told her, "Maybe we can go on a hunting trip together. Have some male bonding time."
        <br />
        <br />
        "I don't want to have male bonding time!" the girl said, "I want to go to the ball!"
        <br />
        <br />
        Still, her family would not allow her to go. Instead, she helped her sisters prepare and tried not to feel too left out.
        <br />
        <br />
        Her sisters went to meet the king. The girl watched until they were out of sight, then fell to the ground crying.
        <br />
        <br />
        Her neighbor heard her sobbing and came to see what was wrong.
        <br />
        <br />
        The girl just shook her head. She was crying too hard to speak.
        <br />
        <br />
        The neighbor was a fairy. He could also do magic, but that was a separate thing. He called for his husband to come help. His husband took one look at the girl and knew what was wrong.
        <br />
        <br />
        "She wants to go to the ball."
        <br />
        <br />
        The girl nodded.
        <br />
        <br />
        "We can fix you up." the neighbor assured her. He brought her to their front porch, where a whole crowd of fairies descended upon her, fixing her hair and chattering about makeup and dresses and names.
        <br />
        <br />
        "She needs a carriage." one fairy said.
        <br />
        <br />
        "Darling, go get a pumpkin from the garden." another fairy instructed the girl.
        <br />
        <br />
        She went obediently and found the prettiest pumpkin she could. She didn't know how it would help, but the fairies seemed to know what they were doing.
        <br />
        <br />
        As soon as she brought back the pumpkin, the fairies scooped out the insides. A couple threw pumpkin guts at each other, giggling. Once the pumpkin was just a shell, the fairies turned it into a fine, golden carriage.
        <br />
        <br />
        Next they sent her to bring back the mousetrap.
        <br />
        <br />
        The girl hesitated. "Aren't mice a little gross?"
        <br />
        <br />
        Her neighbor put a hand on her shoulder. "Gross is not the same as bad." he told her, "Go get the mice."
        <br />
        <br />
        The girl still didn't like mice, but the fairies had been so helpful so far. She decided to trust them. She brought in the mousetrap, keeping her hands carefully far from the actual rodents.
        <br />
        <br />
        The fairies had her open the trapdoor, and as the mice ran out they transformed each one into a beautiful horse. Altogether, she had a finely matched set of six horses, each a dappled, mousy gray.
        <br />
        <br />
        "What do you think?" the fairies asked, "Are you ready to go to the ball?"
        <br />
        <br />
        The girl looked down at her clothes -- boyish, and covered in dirt from playing outside -- and frowned. "Not in these!" she exclaimed.
        <br />
        <br />
        "Of course not, dear!" the fairies agreed, "Here!" and they transformed her clothing into a beautiful gown. It was covered in jewels and twinkled when she moved. When she spun, the skirt flared out around her and she felt like the most beautiful girl in the world.
        <br />
        <br />
        One of the fairies gasped. "Wait here!" he said, and ran into the house. He came back with a beautiful pair of glass slippers. They were delicate and feminine, and just her size. The girl, who the fairies had dubbed Ella, had always felt her feet were too big, but in these shoes they felt just right.
        <br />
        <br />
        The fairy clapped his hands. "Oh! They fit! I hoped they would! Now, are you ready to go?"
        <br />
        <br />
        Ella nodded and thanked the fairies. The fairies gave her strict instructions to be back by midnight and helped her into her carriage and sent her on her way.
        <br />
        <br />
        When she arrived at the ball, the prince himself helped her from her carriage and led her inside. Everyone stopped to stare as they passed. Once they'd had their fill of staring, they turned to each other and whispered, "Did you see? She was so lovely!"
        <br />
        <br />
        The prince danced with her. Ella did not know how to dance, but the prince was a fine teacher and she learned quickly. By the end of the night, she was the most graceful lady on the floor.
        <br />
        <br />
        When dinner was served, she went to sit by her sisters. Her sisters thought she looked familiar, but never connected this fine lady to the person they thought was their brother. The prince didn't eat at all, for that would have interrupted his staring at her.
        <br />
        <br />
        Suddenly, the clock struck eleven forty-five. She immediately excused herself and hurried home. She arrived just in time. Her clothes turned back to what they had been and her horses scattered back into their mouse-holes.
        <br />
        <br />
        The fairies waved and asked her how the ball had been. She recounted everything. The dancing, and the food, and how her sisters had not even known her. "I just wish I could go tomorrow." she said.
        <br />
        <br />
        At that moment, her family arrived back home. Ella scurried inside and met them at the door, pretending she had been asleep. "You stayed so late." she said, "Was the ball fun?"
        <br />
        <br />
        "The most beautiful girl was at the ball." her sisters told her, "You should have seen her. She must have been a princess. And she spent the whole dinner talking with us!"
        <br />
        <br />
        Ella asked the name of the princess, and her sisters admitted they did not know. They told her that the prince was offering a reward for anyone who could tell him who she was.
        <br />
        <br />
        "She must have been very beautiful, then." Ella said, "Could I please go tomorrow to see her?"
        <br />
        <br />
        Her sisters only laughed and went to bed. Ella was quietly relieved at their rejection.
        <br />
        <br />
        The next day, her sisters went to the ball. Ella's neighbors helped her get ready and sent her to the ball looking even more lovely than the night before. The prince stayed near her the entire ball, and was so charming she quite lost track of time. She heard the clock striking twelve and had to flee the palace without even a goodbye. She ran so fast she left behind one of the lovely slippers the fairy had given her. Her gown turned back to boy clothes and all she was left with was a single glass slipper. The prince followed, but could not catch her.
        <br />
        <br />
        The prince asked the guards if they had seen a beautiful princess leave. The guards had not. All they had seen was a boy in grass-stained clothes.
        <br />
        <br />
        When Ella's sisters returned home, she asked if they had seen the princess again. They told her they had, but that she had left in a great hurry and that the prince was now looking for the owner of the glass slipper, for he had fallen in love with her.
        <br />
        <br />
        Over the next several weeks, gossip filtered down from the court that the prince intended to marry whoever the slipper fit. He had tried it on princesses and duchesses and all the noble ladies, but all found their feet were much too small to fit comfortably inside the slipper. Eventually, it was brought to the sisters, who spun stories of how they wore their shoes big, but the prince had heard many such tales and knew that these were not the girl he loved.
        <br />
        <br />
        Ella, who knew it was her slipper, asked if she could try it on.
        <br />
        <br />
        Her sisters rolled their eyes. "Sorry. He's been feeling left out." 
        <br />
        <br />
        The prince said that Ella could try on the shoe. He had her sit down and slid the slipper onto her foot. It fit perfectly. Her sisters were shocked, but they were even more shocked when Ella pulled out its twin and put it on her other foot.
        <br />
        <br />
        Ella pulled back her hair like the fairies had shown her, and her sisters realized that all along she had been the lady from the ball. The prince swept her up in his arms. He thought she was as charming now as she had been in all her finery. He asked her to marry him on the spot. Ella agreed.
        <br />
        <br />
        Her sisters and parents apologized for mistaking her for a boy and for not understanding when she had tried to explain. From that day forward, they called her Ella and invited her on all their sisterly outings. A few days later, Ella and the prince were married, and Ella moved her family into the castle.
